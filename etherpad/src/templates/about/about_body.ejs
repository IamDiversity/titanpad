TitanPad was launched to provide an EtherPad setup which is unrelated to any commercial and political entities. Its goal is to offer a stable service through proper operating.<br/>

It is run by a team of IT professionals based in Austria. If demand is high enough, this operation will be formalized and backed by a non-profit association with the goal to provide a stable EtherPad host.<br/>
